<h1><i><b><font size="50" color="maroon" face="Apple Chancery"><center>Dear Mahi,</font></center></i></b></h1>

<h1><b><font color="maroon" face="Apple Chancery"><center>I know I have been quite unnecessarily troublesome lately, and I don't even want to defend by saying anything, it was just me again, overthinking and feeling silly things in my own mind again, but as always you were still there for me, waiting patiently and selflessly, you reassured me for like the thousandth time and yet I took time to think, which when I think about now, was totally stupid of me, I should've realized much earlier what you were trying to say and I should've known that even though I am just one person, I do hold a lot more value for you than anybody else and my little actions make a huge difference to you, I wish I was more considerate, and I truly regret not being understanding enough to you. I'm extremely sorry baby, I hope you can forgive me one more time despite my countless promises stating I won't repeat it again, I am so grateful for all the times you've understood me and forgiven me, it just proves how much you truly love me, and I swear to god Mahi, it's the best feeling in the whole universe- to be loved this unconditionally and this boundlessly is truly a privilege not everybody in this world gets to experience, and I'm so happy I'm getting to experience it every second of my life since the 29th of June 2024, that to at such a young age. Your love is something nobody in this universe deserves, and you have no idea how deep I feel it inside me everyday, even though you're not close by me, your love lingers around every single corner of my room, house, and every single place I exist and literally in every corner of my heart. Now I believe it when you say that you love me more, yes baby, I got to be fair and give you the win on this one, but of course that doesn't mean I love you any less than that, I too just like you, love you boundlessly, hopelessly, passionately and deeply from every corner of my heart and body. I love you soo soo much Mahika. Thank you soo soo much for being such an amazing life partner, I couldn't be more grateful than this to have such an amazing soul as the partner of my life's journey, it's the best feeling to have my better half with me to tackle every obstacle in life, because everything with you just feels better, no matter if it's a happy and positive moment or a horrible and sad day to forget, you end up making everyday better just with your lively and full of positivity presence. I promise I'll express to you as much as I can and whenever I feel like, I won't hide my emotions which I anyways cannot because with you, my emotions just keep dropping down my eyes, and yes I am almost crying while typing this. Thank you so much for always being there for me when I needed you, and I promise I'll always do the same for you too, I'll never leave your back, I'll always be by your side, whenever you need me, you can come and talk and tell me everything that's in your head, I'll always be more than happy to try my level best to make you feel ten times better after expressing to me, promise. You can always count on me, when you want to, and I'll always be right here for you <3.</font></center></b></h1>

<h1><b><font color="maroon" face="Apple Chancery"><center>Anyways to conclude this, I would like to ask you, the question you've probably been waiting for this whole day (and I'm so freaking sorry for being so late, but of course baby, I could not forget this special day).</font></center></b></h1>

<h1><b><font size="20" color="maroon" face="Apple Chancery"><center>So Mahika Shinde, I Atharva Kokirkar, the boy who you love absolutely hopelessly would like to ask you, on this special Valentines Day of 14th of February 2025....</font></center></b></h1>
